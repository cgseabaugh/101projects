        Lucatiel was born into a family of peasants in Mirrah, an unprivileged part of the society of this kingdom. In order to ensure the well-being of her family, Lucatiel and her brother joined the army. At an early age, she and her brother took up fencing together and, eventually, Lucatiel's skills on the battlefield allowed her to become a knightess of the Order.

        Although Lucatiel was a skilled combatant, she was no match for her brother. She claims that her brother was a far better swordsman than she was, as she was never able to defeat him. At some point in her life, her brother disappeared without a trace. Lucatiel thought that her brother might have fallen victim to the undead curse.
        
        After she contracted the curse of undeath, Lucatiel went to Drangleic as it was rumored that the cure could be found in this land. With time, she became certain that her brother must have come here too. Lucatiel later confides that she feels the curse is taking over her, and that her memories begin to fade away, starting with the oldest.
